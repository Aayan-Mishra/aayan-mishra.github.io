## 1) Intro into diffusion models:

Image generation models are a big part of the modern industry with nearly **57%** of content being AI-generated. These models generate these images through a technique known as **Diffusion**. Diffusion models have emerged as the leading approach for AI image generation. These models work by learning to reverse a process where noise is gradually added to images. Starting with random noise, the model iteratively removes this noise according to learned patterns, eventually producing coherent, detailed images. The technique has proven remarkably effective, powering popular systems like DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion (OdysseyXL's base). By conditioning this denoising process on text prompts, these models can generate highly specific visual content that corresponds to user requests, representing a significant advancement over previous generative techniques.
