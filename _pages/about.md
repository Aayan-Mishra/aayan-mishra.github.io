Hey, I'm **Aayan**—an AI enthusiast who loves working on machine learning, model optimization, and exploring new ideas. I’m always experimenting with projects, from fine-tuning models like **OdysseyXL** for ultra-realism to building advanced AI systems like **Kyro** and **Open-Neo**.  

## What I'm Working On
- **OdysseyXL:** A high-performance AI model designed for creative and professional use cases, focusing on ultra-realism and top-tier performance.  
- **Kyro:** An advanced AI model built for complex problem-solving with adaptive learning abilities.  
- **Open-Neo:** A research lab that is dedicated to working on open-source models

## Outside of AI
When I’m not coding or training models, you’ll probably find me:  
- Watching Formula 1  
- Studying STEM topics  
- Experimenting with new AI tools and ideas  

## My Goal
I want to build AI that makes a real impact—whether it’s pushing the limits of what’s possible or making life easier. I'm always on the lookout for the next big idea.
